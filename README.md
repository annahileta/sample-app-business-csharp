# Business Sample Application: React

## Introduction

The Business Sample App provides ISV developers with a practical example of how to build a quality in-product integration. This is a Single Page Application (SPA) leveraging the Docusign C# eSignature SDK. The SPA is created using React.js and .Net Web API. You can find a live instance at [https://business.sampleapps.docusign.com/](https://business.sampleapps.docusign.com/).

The Business Sample App demonstrates the following:

1. **Authentication** with Docusign via [JWT Grant](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/auth/jwt/) or [ACG](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/auth/authcode/).
2. **Send an Employment Contract:**
   This use case presents a scenario wherein the ISVâ€™s app enables an employee to send an employment contract to a new hire.
   Key elements:
   - Composite templates
   - Envelope-level Connect notifications
   - Electronic or digital signature options (SBS)
   - Embedded sending
   - Remote signing via email notification
3. **T&Cs Contract:**
   This use case presents a scenario in which a sales employee is sending a standard Terms and Conditions document along with a Contract document to an external buyer.
   Key elements:
   - Composite templates
   - Envelope-level Connect notifications
   - Prepopulated field data
   - Recipient Authentication with Access Code
4. **Update Customer Profile Self-service:**
   This use case presents a scenario in which an online customer portal provides a means for customers to update their profiles. The app requires password authentication. As an added level of security, the embedded signing session will require that the signer pass an IDV check.
   Key elements:
   - Composite templates
   - Envelope-level Connect notifications
   - Embedded signing with login data mapped to security elements
   - IDV or SMS/Phone authentication
5. **Custom Quote:**
   This use case presents a scenario in which a sales employee is sending a generated custom quote to a prospective buyer.
   Key elements:
   - Composite templates with anchor tabs
   - Envelope-level Connect notifications
   - Remote signing via SMS delivery
